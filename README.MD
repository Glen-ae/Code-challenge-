## STUDENT GRADE GENERATORY

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

-This project us generated to help a certain school to be able to calculate and assign grades to the students of the particular school.

 ## PROMPT USER
 Â (`let marks = prompt("Present your marks here", "")`
  `if(marks !== null && marks >= 0 && marks <= 100)
   
   This variable helps on the assigning of values which range between 0 to 100 and helps them know their points
## CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
function grades(marks)
    {
        let grade;
        if (marks > 79)
        {
            grade = "A"
        }
        else if (marks > 60)
        {
            grade = "B"
        }
        else if (marks > 49)
        {
            grade = "C"
        }
        else if (marks > 40)
        {
            grade = "D"
        }
        else{
            grading = "E"
